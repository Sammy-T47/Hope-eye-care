INSERT INTO admin_users (id, email, full_name, role)
VALUES (
  'YOUR_USER_UUID_HERE',
  'admin@hopeeyecare.com',

## 🎯 What Works Right Now

### ✅ Fully Functional:
1. **Public Website** - All pages working
2. **Admin Login** - Secure authentication
3. **Admin Dashboard** - Statistics and navigation
4. **Route Protection** - Only admins can access dashboard
5. **Database** - All tables with sample data

### ⏳ Ready for Development:
The placeholder pages are framework-ready. Each manager page can be expanded with full CRUD functionality:

- **Services Manager** → Add/Edit/Delete/Reorder services
- **Doctors Manager** → Add/Edit/Delete/Reorder doctors
- **Blog Manager** → Write/Publish/Edit blog posts
- **FAQs Manager** → Add/Edit/Delete/Reorder FAQs
- **Appointments** → View and update appointment status
- **Messages** → View contact form submissions
- **Settings** → Update clinic phone, email, hours, etc.

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- ✅ Admin-only access enforced by database policies
- ✅ Protected routes require authentication
- ✅ Public data is read-only for non-admins

---

## 📊 Database Tables Created

1. **services** - Clinic services with icons and descriptions
2. **doctors** - Medical team profiles
3. **blog_posts** - Articles and resources
4. **faqs** - Frequently asked questions
5. **clinic_info** - Contact info, hours, address
6. **admin_users** - Staff with dashboard access
7. **appointments** - Patient appointment requests
8. **contact_messages** - Contact form submissions

All tables come with sample data!

## 🎨 Admin Dashboard Features

- **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

### To Add Full CRUD Functionality:

Each manager page (Services, Doctors, Blog, etc.) needs:

1. **List View** - Display all items in a table
2. **Create Form** - Modal or page to add new items
3. **Edit Form** - Update existing items
4. **Delete Confirmation** - Safe deletion with warning
5. **Drag-and-Drop** - Reorder items (optional)
6. **Search/Filter** - Find items quickly (optional)

### Example Manager Page Structure:

```typescript
export default function ServicesManager() {
  const [services, setServices] = useState([]);
  const [isAdding, setIsAdding] = useState(false);

  // Load data
  useEffect(() => {
    loadServices();
  }, []);

  // CRUD functions
  const loadServices = async () => { /* fetch from Supabase */ };
  const createService = async (data) => { /* insert to Supabase */ };
  const updateService = async (id, data) => { /* update in Supabase */ };
  const deleteService = async (id) => { /* delete from Supabase */ };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsAdding(true)}>Add Service</button>
      {/* List of services */}
      {/* Add/Edit modal */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Can't Login?
- Make sure you created the admin user in Supabase Auth
- Confirm the user was added to `admin_users` table
- Check your `.env` file has correct Supabase credentials

### Dashboard Shows Loading Forever?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase connection
- Ensure admin_users table has your user ID

### Build Errors?
- Run `npm install` to ensure all packages are installed
- Check that react-router-dom is installed
- Clear node_modules and reinstall if needed
